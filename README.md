In early 2019, I was decided to format linux partition in my laptop hdd. Just because my OS before, is sometimes felt laggy. When I analyze it, it really surprised me, it's not because my system requirements. But nearly because of DE and some apps which I was installed, eats more RAM, more it can. Now after I was fresh installed OS, I was decided to make backup of it. Or just make simple note about it. So, when I must installing it in another machines again later. It will become less effort.

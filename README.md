Early 2019, was decided to format my linux partition in laptop hdd. Because  sometimes it's felt lags. When I analyze it, it's really surprising me, not because my system requirements. But nearly because of DE and some apps which I was installed and used, eats more RAM, more it can. Now after I was fresh installed OS, I was decided to make backup of it. Or just make simple note about it. So, when I must installing it in another machines again later. It will become less effort.
